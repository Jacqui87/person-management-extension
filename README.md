# Person Manager Application

A full-stack web application for managing person records, built with React and ASP.NET Core 8.

This project began as an implementation of the [UK Parliament's product-senior-developer-home-exercise](https://github.com/ukparliament/product-senior-developer-home-exercise), originally developed and submitted [here](https://github.com/Jacqui87/product-senior-developer-home-exercise). That version was completed within a 7-day window and included a section outlining improvements I would pursue with more time.

This repository continues that work ‚Äî evolving it toward a more robust, production-ready application by turning those aspirations into implementation.

### üåê Bilingual Support (Cymorth Dwyieithog)

The application now fully supports both **English** (`en-GB`) and **Welsh** (`cy-GB`) across the entire user interface ‚Äî including form labels, validation messages, error feedback, navigation items, and instructional text.

Users can choose their preferred language from a dropdown in the interface. This preference is saved and automatically applied the next time they log in, ensuring a consistent experience in their selected language.
