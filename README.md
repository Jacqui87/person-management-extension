# Person Manager Application

A full-stack web application for managing person records, built with React and ASP.NET Core 8.

This project began as an implementation of the [UK Parliament's product-senior-developer-home-exercise](https://github.com/ukparliament/product-senior-developer-home-exercise), originally developed and submitted [here](https://github.com/Jacqui87/product-senior-developer-home-exercise). That version was completed within a 7-day window and included a section outlining improvements I would pursue with more time.

This repository continues that work ‚Äî evolving it toward a more robust, production-ready application by turning those aspirations into implementation.

### üåê Bilingual Support (Cymorth Dwyieithog)

The application now fully supports both **English** (`en-GB`) and **Welsh** (`cy-GB`) across the entire user interface ‚Äî including form labels, validation messages, error feedback, navigation items, and instructional text.

Users can choose their preferred language from a dropdown in the interface. This preference is saved and automatically applied the next time they log in, ensuring a consistent experience in their selected language.

### ‚úÖ Completed

#### 1. Codebase Refinement

- Extracted all **role** and **department** logic from `PersonController.cs`, `PersonService.cs`, and `personService.ts`.
- Created dedicated modules: `RoleService` and `DepartmentService` (both backend and frontend), plus `RoleController` and `DepartmentController`.
- This improves separation of concerns, simplifies testing, and prepares the codebase for scalability.

#### 2. Targeted Testing Improvements

- Separated existing tests to match new service boundaries (`PersonService`, `RoleService`, `DepartmentService`, etc.).
- Tests are now more modular, easier to navigate, and follow single-responsibility principles.
- Improves maintainability by ensuring tests target specific domain logic rather than broad controller behaviors.

#### 3. Frontend Performance Optimisation

- Added lazy loading for top-level React components (PersonConfig, LoginPage, etc.) using React.lazy and Suspense.
- Improves initial load time and performance by deferring non-critical component loading until needed.

#### 4. English/Welsh Internationalisation (not yet configurable by a user)

- Integrated react-i18next for translation handling.
- All major UI labels, validation messages, and instructional content now available in both English and Welsh.
- Users can choose their preferred language via the UI.
- Translation keys grouped by domain (common, person_editor, search_bar, etc.) for clarity and scalability.
