# Person Manager Application

A full-stack web application for managing person records, built with React and ASP.NET Core 8.

This project began as an implementation of the [UK Parliament's product-senior-developer-home-exercise](https://github.com/ukparliament/product-senior-developer-home-exercise), originally developed and submitted [here](https://github.com/Jacqui87/product-senior-developer-home-exercise). That version was completed within a 7-day window and included a section outlining improvements I would pursue with more time.

This repository continues that work ‚Äî evolving it toward a more robust, production-ready application by turning those aspirations into implementation.

### üåê Bilingual Support (Cymorth Dwyieithog)

The application fully supports both **English** (`en-GB`) and **Welsh** (`cy-GB`) throughout the user interface ‚Äî including form labels, validation messages, error feedback, navigation, and instructional text.

Users can choose their preferred language from a dropdown in the interface. This preference is saved and automatically applied the next time they log in, ensuring a consistent experience in their selected language.

### ‚úÖ Completed

#### 1. Codebase Refinement

Separated role and department logic into dedicated backend and frontend modules, enhancing modularity, easing testing, and improving scalability.

#### 2. Targeted Testing Improvements

Reorganized tests by service boundaries to increase modularity and maintainability, focusing on specific domain logic.

#### 3. Frontend Performance Optimisation

Implemented lazy loading for React components and integrated TanStack Query to optimize data fetching, caching, and reduce initial load times.

#### 4. English/Welsh Internationalisation

Added bilingual UI support with react-i18next, enabling users to select their language with well-structured translation keys.

#### 5. Clearable Search & Autocomplete Dropdowns

Improved filter UI by adding clearable inputs and MUI Autocomplete components for roles and departments, enhancing UX and accessibility.

#### 6. ESLint Integration

Configured ESLint with TypeScript rules to enforce code quality, providing better developer feedback during development.

#### 7. API Improvements

Updated backend API to use PATCH with JSON Patch for partial updates instead of PUT, sending minimal change payloads. Frontend was adapted to generate and send JSON Patch documents with proper headers, improving efficiency and accurately reflecting partial updates.
